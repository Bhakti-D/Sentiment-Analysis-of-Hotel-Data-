#### About this Dataset
Once there was a businessman having a good hotel in the city of Mussoorie near Mall Road. Well, what struck your mind first when your heard about Mussoorie? Let me guess, and i am certain that it was beautiful mountains, greenery, cold breeze, and scenic beauty. So to enjoy all this you must have a great place to stay and for this comfortability we are talking about that businessmen who owns a hotel in this beautiful hill station.
But this business man was old and his hotel had a very gentle and nice vintage touch , a place where you can sense the glory of past time along with the essence of woods from which it was made. It had soft carpets , beautiful wooden crafted bed, velvet stitched cushions and a fire place in every room to make you feel comfortable and cozy in your stay. Overall I can say that it was such a place where you can get the British times architecture along with Indian hospitality.
As we have seen in all these years of rapid advancement in urban sector and tourism that sometimes in the race of this modern world the vintage and old crafts lag behind. its not because that the owners of such businesses does not want to go ahead its just they don't know the right course of action and also the right idea that in what field they are lagging and exactly what their customers are expecting from them.
The owner of one such business asked you to somehow figure out what are the positives and negatives about his hotel according to the customer. He gave you a csv file which contains reviews, date of stay and rating given by reviewer. He also asked you to somehow help in predicting the sentiment of some reviews.
